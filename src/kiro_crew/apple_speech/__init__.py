"""Apple on-device speech-to-text (``apple`` STT provider) — macOS only.

Apple's ``SpeechAnalyzer`` / ``SpeechTranscriber`` (macOS 26+) is a **Swift-only**
framework, so the gateway cannot call it in-process. This module owns the
out-of-process seam: it compiles the bundled ``AppleTranscribe.swift`` helper on
demand, caches the binary under the data home, and runs it as a subprocess that
returns one line of JSON.

Why compile on demand rather than ship a binary: a prebuilt Mach-O would have to be
signed and notarized to survive Gatekeeper on a downloaded DMG, and would need one
slice per macOS deployment target. Compiling once against the *host's* SDK sidesteps
both and keeps the wheel architecture-neutral. The cost is a hard dependency on the
Xcode Command Line Tools, which is why :func:`availability` reports the missing
toolchain as its own distinguishable state instead of a generic "unavailable".

**Model tier is not selectable.** Apple exposes no API to request the
"Advanced Dictation" (AFM 3 Core Advanced) model, nor to query which tier served a
request — the whole ``Speech.SpeechModels`` enum is a single ``endRetention()``
function. The OS decides based on hardware. Do not add a config knob implying
otherwise.
