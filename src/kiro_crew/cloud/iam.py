"""cloud IAM — least-privilege policy generator + read-only reachability check.

Same philosophy as ``deploy_web/iam.py``: **KiroCrew never performs an IAM
write.** We *generate* the policy text for the user to apply themselves (or they
already have it, being the account owner). Verification is **read-only
reachability only** — ``sts get-caller-identity`` plus harmless ``describe``
calls; the first ``cloudformation deploy`` is the true permission test, and on
``AccessDenied`` the exact missing action is surfaced (see ``cloud.aws``).

The launch path is heavier than deploy-web's: it creates an IAM role and passes
it to EC2 (``iam:PassRole``), which requires ``CAPABILITY_IAM`` on the deploy.
We surface that honestly in the wizard rather than trying to shrink below what
CloudFormation needs.
