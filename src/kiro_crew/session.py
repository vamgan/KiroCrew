"""Session manager — maps conversation session keys to LLM provider sessions.

Each conversation (channel thread, dashboard slot, CLI) gets its own
LLMProvider instance. Sessions are
cleaned up after idle timeout (default 30 min).

Warm session pool: ``start_pool()`` pre-spawns kiro-cli processes so
``get_or_create()`` returns instantly.  After handing out a warm session,
a replacement is created in the background to maintain the target count.

Background session: ``BACKGROUND_KEY`` is a persistent shared session for
lightweight background work (cron, heartbeat, lesson extraction).  It
stays alive between uses, serialized by the per-session semaphore.

At >= ``cfg.session.autocompact_pct`` context usage, fires a background
compaction task. Both backends compact **in place** so the session — and
any queued or agentic work on it — continues without a user nudge:

* **kiro-cli:** run ``/compact`` in place under the session semaphore
  (native command execute + ``_kiro.dev/compaction/status`` wait). The
  process and session ID survive; the conversation is summarized in
  place. If the in-place compact fails or times out, fall back to the
  legacy **recycle**: kill the session and let the next user message
  re-seed context via ``build_session_context()`` (the session_map entry
  is dropped to avoid false-resume from stale state). A recycle is never
  forced through a live turn — if the turn semaphore cannot be acquired,
  the attempt is skipped and re-triggered at the next turn end.
* **claude-agent-acp:** run ``/compact`` in place under the session
  semaphore. The SDK preserves the same session ID across the
  compact_boundary; the session keeps its summary and continues without
  a recycle.

A failed compact records a per-key cooldown so a broken /compact does
not fire on every subsequent turn. The compact callback fires on both
success and failure; the dashboard uses ``success`` to choose the
banner copy. The user's response is never blocked — compaction is
fire-and-forget.

Circuit breaker: after 5 consecutive failures on a session, the session
is force-reset instead of retrying forever.

Per-session semaphore: serializes prompts on the same session key so
concurrent messages on the same conversation don't interleave.

Process Sweep Architecture
--------------------------
Four mechanisms clean up processes. They are complementary — not redundant.

1. ``cleanup_orphaned_sessions()`` — **startup + shutdown only**.
   Reads ``kiro_session_pids.txt`` (bare sandbox root PIDs from the previous
   gateway run). Validates each with ``_is_managed_agent_process``, kills descendants
   bottom-up, then kills the root. Truncates the file afterward.
   *Cannot be replaced by the periodic sweep* because sandbox roots are
   independent processes with no idle timeout — they survive indefinitely
   unless explicitly killed.

2. ``_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Reads ``kiro_pids.txt`` (child:parent pairs). Kills children whose parent
   is confirmed dead. PPid-based reuse guard prevents killing recycled PIDs.
   Also prunes dead bare PIDs. *Depends on (1)* — children are only orphaned
   after their sandbox root is killed.

3. ``_expire_idle()`` — **periodic** (every ~5 min).
   Kills sessions idle for >``timeout_secs`` (default 30 min) via
   ``reset()`` → ``provider.shutdown()`` → SIGKILL process tree.
   Protected keys: ``_PERSISTENT_KEYS`` (``_bg`` and ``_hb``).
   **Known limitation**: ``last_used`` is only bumped on ``get_or_create()``,
   not on every LLM round-trip. A task runner step doing continuous work for
   >30 min without a new ``get_or_create()`` call could be swept. This is
   accepted for now to prevent runaway tasks, but may need a heartbeat or
   persistent-key mechanism if longer steps become common.

        ``resumed`` is True when the session was restored via ACP session/load
        (kiro-cli has full native history — skip thread history injection).

        For new sessions, tries the warm pool first for instant startup.
        If the session is mid-compaction, creates a fresh one instead.
        Acquires the per-session semaphore before returning — caller MUST
        call ``release(key)`` when done.

        Args:
            agent: Optional agent name for ``session/set_mode``.  Non-default
                agents skip the warm pool (cold start only).
            model: Optional model override for the session.  When ``None``,
                falls back to the global ``agent.model`` config — but only when
                the named agent does not pin its own model (a per-agent pin
                outranks the global fallback) and the global is not a sentinel
                value like ``"auto"``, in which case it stays ``None`` to let
                the backend resolve from the agent's own JSON config.  Flows
                through to the provider factory as the ``model_override`` kwarg.
            speculative: The caller is pre-creating the session ahead of a real
                first turn (eager spawn) rather than running one.  Three atomic
                consequences, all inside this method so no caller-side
                check-then-act window exists: the one-shot first-turn flag is
                never consumed (a speculative creator registers the session
                with it still armed; a speculative claimant leaves it as-is);
                a key with a resume mapping raises
                :class:`SpeculativeResumeRefused` instead of resuming (unless
                ``speculative_resume`` opts in), because
                the real first turn must be the one that observes
                ``resumed=True``; and the returned ``is_new`` reflects the
                flag's state without consuming it.
            speculative_resume: Only meaningful with ``speculative=True``.
                Opts in to speculatively resuming a persisted session
                (resume prefetch): instead of refusing a resumable key, the
                speculative creator performs the session/load and registers
                the session with the one-shot observation armed as
                :attr:`FirstTurnState.RESUMED` when the load actually
                restored the transcript. The first real claimant consumes it
                atomically under the per-session semaphore and receives
                ``(provider, True, True)``, preserving its
                history-injection decision exactly as if it had performed the

        pop (so no turn can start and no session swap can slip into a
        released-lock window), used by the RSS-recycle watchdog:

          * ``expect_session`` — only reset if this exact session object still
            occupies ``key``. Guards against recycling a session that was
            reset+recreated under a reused key between an off-lock RSS
            measurement and this call (the victim would otherwise be killed on
            the prior occupant's stale reading).
          * ``skip_if_busy`` — skip if the current session has a turn in flight
            (semaphore held), so a live stream is never cut mid-turn. This is
            enforced here, atomically with the pop, rather than in a caller's
            separate lock acquisition (which reopens the window).

        ``clear_conversation`` additionally drops the session map's native
        resume sid (the entry itself — and the channel bindings it carries —
        survives, exactly as in ``_recycle_held``): used by the still-critical
        post-compaction escalation, where resuming the overflowed conversation
        would reload the very context the reset exists to shed. The clear runs
        in the SAME event-loop tick as the pop (no await between them), so a
        racing cold-start can never have registered a replacement sid for this
        key in between — the clear cannot erase a successor's pointer.

        Both entry points consume this ladder — ``check_context_usage`` via
        :meth:`_trigger_compaction` (which schedules the attempt) and
        :meth:`compact_if_needed` (which awaits it) — so a gate added here
        reaches both paths by construction; gate-order parity between the
        paths is pinned by ``test_task_runner_compaction.py``. Returns the
        decline reason, or ``None`` to proceed. *pct* is the reading the
        caller observed on *provider*; the ladder never re-reads it.

        The gates run in this order, and the order is behavior:

        1. Pending-verdict settle — a side effect, never declines. The first
           CONFIRMED reading after a deferred attempt settles its verdict
           (see ``_settle_compact_cooldown``) and MUST run before the
           cooldown gate below, so an ineffective prior attempt suppresses
           the immediate re-trigger within this very call. Deliberately
           damping-only: a deferred reading includes the following turn's
           own growth and cannot distinguish a failed compaction from a
           successful one regrown by a large turn — safe to damp on, never
           safe to reset on (the promoted #4686 escalation fires only on
           immediately-measured verdicts inside ``_compact_session``).
        2. ``"cc_managed"`` — CC ``per_session`` compacts natively; checked
           before the threshold, so a CC session below threshold also
           declines here.
        3. ``"below_threshold"`` — *pct* below ``session.autocompact_pct``.
        4. ``"unconfirmed"`` — over threshold but no telemetry has confirmed
           the reading for the CURRENT session binding; defensive twin of
           the rekey-time reset (#2932). Compaction is destructive-ish (it
           rewrites the conversation), so it must never fire on an unproven
           percentage. Today every path that raises context_pct also calls
           note_pct_reported(), so this gate is unreachable in production —
           it exists so a future handoff/reset path that preserves a stale
           pct while leaving it flagged unknown degrades to a skipped
           compaction instead of compacting an empty session. Fail-quiet on
           doubles: providers without the probe read as "confirmed".
        5. ``"in_progress"`` — the ``_compacting`` dedup, CHECK only. The
           caller commits with ``_compacting.add(key)`` itself, synchronously
           after a ``None`` return: committing here would leak a stale entry
           whenever the cooldown gate below declines, and committing at the
           call site keeps the check-then-add handshake atomic on the event
           loop (this method never awaits).
        6. ``"cooldown"`` — a failed or ineffective attempt armed
           ``_compact_cooldown_until``; re-triggers are suppressed until it
           elapses so a broken or ineffective ``/compact`` does not fire on
           every subsequent turn.

        The declining gates that log (unconfirmed / in_progress / cooldown)
        log here, identically for both entry points; the silent declines
        (cc_managed / below_threshold) are logged, where at all, by the
        entry-point arms that own them.

        - ``"ok"``: compaction completed; session (and its process) survives.
          The success callback has been fired and the cooldown settled from
          the measured effect (cleared when effective, armed when
          ineffective, deferred when not yet measurable).
        - ``"reset"``: compaction completed, but the immediately-measured
          verdict was ineffective-and-still-critical and the promoted #4686
          escalation tore the session down HERE — before the compaction
          callback, so a turn completing inside the callback's await window
          can never be erased by it.
        - ``"busy"``: the turn semaphore could not be acquired within
          ``COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS`` — a turn is still running. Nothing was
          attempted; the caller must NOT recycle (no mid-turn kill).
        - ``"recycled"``: the compact was attempted and failed (or timed out,
          or the provider has no native compaction — base
          ``wait_for_compaction`` returns ``{"type": "timeout"}``), so the
          session was recycled HERE, before the turn semaphore was released.

        Every outcome is terminal: the caller never recycles.

        Holds the session semaphore for the duration so a queued turn waits
        behind the compaction (and then continues on the compacted session)
        instead of interleaving with it.

        The semaphore is held across the failure recycle too, and that is
        load-bearing. Releasing it first and letting the caller re-acquire
        leaves a gap a queued turn wins: the turn is then dispatched into a
        kiro-cli that is still compacting, its late ``completed`` status lands
        in that turn's stream, and no ``end_turn`` ever follows — the turn
        hangs holding the semaphore until the 2h prompt timeout, and the
        recycle that would have rescued it gives up at its own acquire
        timeout. Observed in production 2026-08-05: a ``/compact`` reported
        ``completed`` 161s in, 41s after the async wait
        had already declared timeout.

        the async compaction caller must then AWAIT the promoted reset
        escalation before reporting its outcome (#4686). A deferred verdict
        returns ``False``; it settles at the next confirmed reading in
        :meth:`_compaction_gate_decision`, the gate ladder shared by
        ``check_context_usage`` and ``compact_if_needed``.

        Re-reads ``context_usage_pct()`` and compares it with *pct_before* (the
        reading that triggered the attempt). A completed compaction that freed
        less than ``_COMPACT_MIN_EFFECT_PCT_POINTS`` is INEFFECTIVE: without a
        cooldown the next turn-end ``check_context_usage`` re-triggers at once
        and every "successful" attempt pays another model-generated
        summarization. Reusing the failure cooldown (rather than a second
        constant or counter) keeps one damping mechanism for both outcomes.

        The verdict is only made on a reading that demonstrably describes the
        compacted conversation. Two normal paths cannot provide one here:

        - kiro-cli, terminal status observed MID-TURN: the stream handler ran
          ``reset_after_compaction`` (pct 0.0, flagged unknown) and no
          post-compaction metadata drain has run yet — the reading is unknown.
        - a backend whose stats were never reset by the compaction: the
          reading still shows the PRE-compaction value, so a fully successful
          compaction would compute a zero drop and be damped by mistake.

        Both defer: the trigger pct is stashed in ``_compact_pending_verdict``
        and :meth:`_compaction_gate_decision` settles it at the first
        CONFIRMED reading (that reading includes the following turn's own
        growth, so a very large turn can under-measure the drop and arm one
        spurious cooldown — bounded at ``_COMPACT_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECS``).
        Any cooldown already running is left to expire on its own while a
        verdict is pending.

        The compaction callback still fires ``success=True`` for an
        ineffective attempt: the compaction genuinely completed and rewrote
        the conversation, so skill-context reinjection (gated on success in
        ``_fire_compact_callback``) must run, and the failure notice
        ("will retry after cooldown — run /compact manually") would
        misdescribe an attempt that ran to completion. The warning below

        Covers FIVE holders. The session map is the obvious one; the others are
        each independently sufficient to keep the old account alive:

        * ``_warm_pool`` -- spawned before the change and handed to a BRAND-NEW
          session afterwards, so that session runs as the old account despite
          never having existed under it. Drained under ``_pool_fill_lock`` so a
          fill already in flight cannot land a just-spawned child into a queue we
          have already swept.
        * ``_subagent_runtimes`` -- separate processes the session sweep cannot
          reach.
        * ``_bg_runtime`` -- one shared process serving background work, retired
          under its own lock.
        * companion runtimes keyed by a retired session, via
          ``release_subagent_runtime``.

        Registered sessions are retired with the same bookkeeping as
        :meth:`remove`, so the session map is PRESERVED: the next turn cold starts
        a fresh child and ``session/load`` restores the conversation from disk
        losslessly. Retiring is a process recycle, not data loss.

        A BUSY session is skipped rather than killed: its turn started under the
        old account and killing it mid-stream would surface as an unexplained
        failure. It is retired by the next turn's check, and ``complete=False``
        keeps the change pending until then.

        Every gateway restart and Dev-Fleet 'Make Live' cutover funnels through
        ``close_all()`` (the systemd cutover via the SIGTERM shutdown path, the
        in-process update-restart via ``_restart_gateway``). Without this step
        ``close_all()`` shuts each session's provider down immediately, so a slot
        that is mid-prompt has its kiro-cli killed with the native turn still
        open — leaving the native-session lock (``~/.kiro/sessions/cli/<uuid>.json``)
        held. When the new gateway resumes that slot via ``session/load`` kiro-cli
        rejects with "active in another process" and the slot returns EMPTY
        completions until the stale lock times out. This is the root cause of
        the Make-Live empty-response failure this drain prevents.

        For each registered session with an active turn, issue a graceful ACP
        ``session/cancel`` and wait (bounded) for the turn-done ack, so the
        native turn closes cleanly and kiro-cli can release the lock on the
        subsequent SIGTERM. The whole operation is bounded by ``timeout``; on
        timeout we log a warning and return so the caller falls through to the
        (SIGTERM-first) kill path — the drain never hangs teardown and never
        raises. ``timeout <= 0`` disables the drain entirely.

        Closes the lease-dispatch race (Codex HIGH). A caller obtains a session
        and its per-session semaphore *lease* from :meth:`get_or_create`, does
        async prep, then drives ``provider.stream(...)``. The ``_closing`` gate in
        ``get_or_create`` only blocks callers that have NOT yet acquired a lease;
        a caller that took its lease BEFORE ``close_all`` set ``_closing`` can
        still reach dispatch AFTER — and an already-issued lease cannot be
        revoked. Such a turn would first open *after* ``drain_active_turns``'s
        snapshot, be absent from the drain set, and get killed mid-turn with its
        native-session lock held (the empty-response-after-restart bug, #200).

        The caller MUST therefore call ``begin_turn`` **synchronously, with no
        await in between**, immediately before the stream drive. This method only
        *reads* ``_closing`` — atomic in the single-threaded event loop, so no
        lock is needed — and the stream's synchronous prefix clears the native
        turn-done event (registering the turn) before its first ``await`` (see
        ``AcpClient.stream_events``: ``_turn_done.clear()`` precedes
        ``await ensure_ready()``). So the ``_closing`` read here and that turn
        registration form ONE yield-free span; in the event loop that span is
        strictly ordered w.r.t. ``close_all``'s ``_closing`` set — the turn is
        EITHER registered before the drain snapshot (and thus drained) OR the
        caller aborts here. It can never straddle, so no un-drained turn opens
        during the drain window.

        NOTE: making this ``async`` / lock-guarded would REOPEN the race — the
        ``await`` would yield the loop between the check and the turn
        registration, letting ``close_all`` snapshot in between. ``key`` is
        accepted for API symmetry and possible future per-key gating; the
        current shutdown signal is manager-global.

        """Report a turn whose consumer has stopped pulling events.

        This exists because the per-turn watchdog cannot report on itself. That
        watchdog is the ``except asyncio.TimeoutError`` arm of
        ``AcpSessionHandle._dispatch_events``, an async generator, so it advances
        only when a consumer pulls it — and a consumer that awaits inside its own
        ``async for`` body (a tool approval, an IM send, a hook) freezes the
        generator at the yield, after which that arm never executes again for the
        rest of the turn. It is not slow or mis-verdicted there; it is not called,
        which is why such a turn produces no stall WARNING at all. This loop has
        its own timer and no dependency on any consumer, so it still runs.

        Detection only, for three separate reasons:

        * A turn waiting for a HUMAN is excluded outright. That wait is bounded by
          ``agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs``, and acting on it here would put
          two components on different budgets racing to end the same wait.
        * Ending a live-but-parked turn belongs to the in-band path, which owns
          the terminal-event seam and the non-lethal continue-nudge recovery. A
          second terminator would either double-emit or land a cancel ack on a
          turn that has already completed.
        * What the park is blocked ON is not knowable from here, so there is no
          unambiguous action to take. Reporting converts a silent freeze into a
          named one, which is the whole of the diagnostic gap.

        Swallows its own errors like its sibling hooks: an observer must never be
        able to break the cleanup pass it rides on.
