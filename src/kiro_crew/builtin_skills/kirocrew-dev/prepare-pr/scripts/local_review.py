"""local_review.py - assemble the LOCAL pre-push reviewer briefs from CI's own workflows.

The prepare-pr skill's Phase-2 gate only has value if the local reviewers judge a
commit against the SAME contract the server reviewers will. Every hand-written
"charter" in a skill file is a paraphrase, and a paraphrase drifts the moment
someone tunes a workflow prompt: local review then goes green on a bar the server
does not use, and the drift is invisible until the server round that finds it.

So this script does not describe the contract - it EXTRACTS it, live, from the
reviewer workflows at the worktree's own checkout, and assembles one task file
per reviewer:

  * GPT lane (spliced-prompt workflow, e.g. .github/workflows/codex-review.yml):
    the reviewer prompt is assembled purely by splicing shared
    `.github/review-prompts/gpt-*.md` files, in the workflow's own order, into
    one document. We stage the shared files from the base commit exactly as
    the workflow's loader does (honouring its `cp` bootstrap for the PR that
    introduces one), concatenate them VERBATIM in splice order (SYSTEM RULES,
    REPO CONTEXT, DIVISION OF LABOUR, the severity/blocking contract, OUTPUT
    STYLE - all of it), substitute the GitHub event expressions with local
    values, and append the same two-pass discovery/falsification instructions
    the workflow passes per pass.
  * Opus lane (prompt-file-shaped workflow, e.g. .../claude-review.yml): the
    contract lives in base-ref prompt FILES plus a small inline wrapper prompt.
    We lift the wrapper block scalars verbatim and stage the base-ref prompt
    files exactly as the workflow does (no fallback - a missing prompt is a hard
    failure there and here).

It also assembles the same auxiliary inputs the workflows assemble: base-ref
AUTOSDE rule snapshots (so a PR cannot weaken the rules that govern it), a
prefetched diff, and the PR intent (PR title/body when a PR exists, else the
commit message) wrapped in the workflow's own UNTRUSTED framing block.

This script NEVER calls a model. It only assembles inputs and prints where they
landed; the skill dispatches the reviewers with them.

Nothing is written inside the worktree: the staging tree lives under the system
temp dir and every relative path the workflows use (`.review-base-rules/...`,
`.review-prompts/...`, `.review-candidates.md`) is rewritten in the extracted
text to its absolute staged twin. A local review therefore cannot dirty the tree
that Phase 3 is about to push.

Stdlib only; Python 3.10+ (the package floor), like its sibling scripts.

Usage:
    python3 local_review.py [--worktree PATH] [--base REF]
                            [--out-dir DIR] [--stage-dir DIR] [--json]

Exit:
    0  briefs assembled (paths printed)
    2  environment / state error (not a git repo, no diff, no reviewers, ...)

    Reviewer authority has exactly two inputs: this validated string and the git
    object the base ref stores under it. The branch checkout is never consulted -
    this function performs no filesystem operation, and takes no worktree to
    perform one against. That is the invariant, not an optimisation: resolving
    the path on disk delegates the decision to the tree under review, and a
    branch that replaces ``codex-review.yml`` with an in-repo symlink to
    ``claude-review.yml`` resolves to the Claude workflow - so ``git show
    base:<path>`` loads the wrong reviewer's contract and the declared lane is
    mirrored against rules it was never meant to be judged by, or skipped
    outright. Containment cannot be delegated to a filesystem the branch
    controls, so it is decided from the string alone.

    The contract is data from that tree: a repo-root ``.prepare-pr.toml``
    supplies it. Rejected lexically - a non-string value (a bare ``contract = 2``
    that TOML parses as an integer, a table, an array) cannot name a path and
    owes the caller a parity failure with its exit code, not a ``TypeError``
    traceback from outside the documented contract; an empty value names no file;
    a backslash is not a git path separator, so it either names a file whose
    literal name contains one or smuggles a Windows-spelled traversal past a
    ``/``-only check; an absolute path (a POSIX leading ``/``, or a ``C:`` drive
    prefix) is not repo-relative at all; and any ``..`` segment climbs out of the
    repository. ``.`` segments and repeated slashes are dropped, so what reaches
