"""ACP client — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio with `kiro-cli acp` or `claude-agent-acp`.

Protocol (ACP JSON-RPC 2.0):
  initialize → session/new → session/set_mode → session/set_model → session/prompt
  (claude backend: skips set_mode and uses session/set_config_option for model)

Agent selection: ``session/set_mode`` with ``modeId`` activates the agent
config (prompt, tools, resources).  MCP servers are passed explicitly
in ``session/new`` via the ``mcpServers`` parameter.

Permission flow:
  ← session/request_permission (server→client REQUEST with uuid id)
  → {result: {outcome: {outcome: "selected", optionId: "allow_once"}}}

# optionalDependencies that a plain ``npm i -g
# @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`` may omit, so the SDK can fail
# session/new with "Claude native binary not found for <platform>".  The SDK
# does NOT auto-discover a `claude` on PATH — it only looks for that bundled
# native package — so having it installed on the host is not enough; we point
# the adapter at it explicitly via CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE (the env var the
# adapter forwards to the SDK as pathToClaudeCodeExecutable).
# ``augmented_path()`` includes the common Node install locations
# (mise/nvm/fnm/volta shims, npm global bin), so this resolves with no user
# action when the binary is on PATH; otherwise the adapter surfaces its own
# native-binary error.

# same node_modules root.  Its presence is a cheap completeness check: a
# copy missing it would crash at import with

# incomplete root and fall through to the next candidate.

# High-frequency, content-free adapter stderr diagnostics that _drain_stderr()
# drops instead of forwarding as per-line WARNINGs.  The driving case is the
# claude-agent-acp "Unexpected case: {...thinking_tokens...}" line.  Mechanism
# (confirmed by reading the vendored adapter, dist/acp-agent.js): the backend
# emits a `system` message with subtype `thinking_tokens`, but the adapter's
# `switch (message.subtype)` enumerates ~18 known subtypes (init, status,
# compact_boundary, memory_recall, api_retry, ...) and routes anything else to
# `default: unreachable(message)`, which does `logger.error("Unexpected case:
# " + JSON.stringify(message))` to stderr — one line per token delta.  Measured
# at ~10 lines/sec during active thinking (one line per 2-4 thinking tokens; the
# payload is only estimated_tokens/_delta/uuid/session_id — no response content,
# so dropping them loses nothing).
#
# This is a forward-compat gap in the adapter, NOT new behavior in a specific
# backend build: the `thinking_tokens` event is present in both 2.1.165.357
# and 2.1.168.358 (verified by string-matching both bundled `claude` binaries —
# identical occurrences), so it predates the .168 update that drew attention to
# it.  Exactly when it began appearing in our logs is unconfirmed.  The cleaner
# long-term fix is upstream (add a `thinking_tokens` case to the adapter / bump
# the vendored version); this filter is the version-agnostic stopgap that also
# absorbs the next unenumerated subtype's flood.
#
# Why drop rather than just downgrade the level:
#   1. Log hygiene — gateway.log uses a RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB,
#      backupCount=3) (see cli.py), so a sustained burst rolls genuine
#      diagnostics out of the retained 8MB window.
#   2. Event-loop load — the file handler is a plain *synchronous* handler and
#      _drain_stderr runs as a task on the gateway event loop, so each forwarded
#      line costs a synchronous file write + two regex redaction passes on the
#      same loop that streams responses.  Per-session the cost is small; it
#      compounds across concurrent thinking sessions.
# (This is a log-volume / event-loop-load reduction, NOT a fix for any
# turn-stall or "agent not responding" symptom — no such causal link was
# established.)
#
# Match on a stable substring (not the full JSON) so the filter survives field
# changes, and keep the tuple NARROW so a genuine error line is never silently
# swallowed.

    **Call this from an executor, never inline on the event loop.** On Windows it
    reads the config file (through ``apply_windows_resource_ceiling``) and walks
    two Toolhelp snapshots — the process table for the ownership check and the
    system-wide THREAD table to resume — so a slow config store or a loaded
    machine would otherwise stall every other session on that loop. Both ACP
    spawn sites wrap it in ``run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), ...)``. It
    stays synchronous rather than becoming a coroutine because every step is
    blocking ctypes work with no await point to offer.

    Both ACP spawn sites (:meth:`AcpClient._spawn` and ``AcpRuntime._spawn``)
    create the session host with ``creationflags |=
    platform_compat.CREATE_SUSPENDED`` and call this immediately afterwards. On
    POSIX every step is a no-op — ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` is 0 there, so the child
    was never suspended — which keeps one code path for both platforms.

    Why suspended: ``cgroup_scope_argv`` is a no-op on Windows (no systemd), so
    without this the agent and every MCP server it spawns would run with NO
    fork-bomb and NO memory-DoS ceiling. A Job object cannot be an argv prefix,
    so it must be attached to a live pid — and job membership covers a member's
    FUTURE descendants only. Attaching to an already-running kiro-cli would
    therefore leave a window in which it could spawn an MCP server that escapes
    the ceiling. ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` closes that window by construction: the
    child has not executed a single instruction, so it provably has no
    descendants. Assign the job, then resume.

    A resume failure is FATAL, but only when the child is actually there: a
    process that exists yet cannot be resumed is alive-but-frozen, and letting it
    masquerade as a running agent would hang the session on the ACP handshake
    with no diagnosis. Kill it and raise instead. If the pid is already gone
    there is nothing frozen to worry about — it exited on its own — so note it
    and let the handshake surface the real error.

    The ceiling itself fails SOFT (``apply_windows_resource_ceiling`` logs a
    SECURITY warning and returns False): a missing ceiling must not break the
    gateway. Only the resume may abort the spawn, which is why it runs from a
    ``finally`` — a raising ceiling must still leave the child resumed or killed,
    never frozen.

    The two DESTRUCTIVE steps are gated on confirmed ownership: the pid's parent
    must be this process. A Job object would impose a process and memory ceiling
    on a stranger, and the unresumable branch KILLS what it is holding, so
    neither may ever act on a pid we did not create. The resume itself is NOT
    gated, because ``ResumeThread`` on a thread that is not suspended is a
    documented no-op (its suspend count is already 0) — and leaving our own child
    frozen would hang the session forever on the handshake with no diagnosis.
    That asymmetry is deliberate: an unconfirmed pid loses only its ceiling,
    which already fails soft by contract, while nothing can wedge or die by
    mistake.

        discipline as ``JsonRpcMessage.is_response_for`` (a *response* has an
        id + no method; a *request* has both id AND method):

        - Notifications (method + no id): buffered in ``_mcp_notifications`` for
          ``_drain_notifications`` to process.
        - Matching response (id == req_id + no method): returned.
        - Server→client request (method + id) and foreign-id responses
          (id != req_id + no method): collected into a LOCAL ``deferred`` list
          and re-injected into ``self._buffer`` IN ORDER once the matching
          response arrives or on timeout.

        Server requests and foreign responses must NOT be re-appended to
        ``self._buffer`` mid-loop and ``continue``-d: ``_read_message`` pops
        ``self._buffer`` first, so it would immediately re-read the same frame,
        re-defer it, and spin until the deadline (the original bug). Holding
        them in a local list until exit guarantees forward progress while
        preserving the frame so a later ``_prompt_loop`` / ``_process_message``
        can answer the deferred ``session/request_permission`` request.

        The deadline is **activity-based**: any received message (notification,
        deferred frame, or the matching response) resets it to ``now + timeout``,
        bounded by an absolute ``_WAIT_RESPONSE_MAX_TIMEOUT`` safety cap. This
        keeps a long ``session/load`` replay (which streams the entire prior
        transcript as ``session/update`` notifications before resolving) alive
        instead of being killed by a fixed wall-clock and silently falling back

        The oracle walks ``/proc`` for the backend subprocess subtree — a
        synchronous filesystem walk that can block on a wedged fd — so it runs
        on ``subprocess_executor()`` under a bounded timeout, the same treatment
        the runtime's other /proc probes get. Any failure or timeout degrades to
        a non-WORKING verdict so the caller falls through to ending the turn
        (fail toward reaping, never toward hanging).

        Scope, mirroring the shared-runtime oracle this converges onto:
        - Linux-only evidence. On a host without ``/proc`` the verdict is
          UNKNOWN → the turn is reaped at the cutoff exactly as before this
          gate existed, so the change is behavior-preserving off Linux and a
          strict improvement on the gateway's Linux deploy target.
        - Subtree-aggregate movement. A busy *unrelated* descendant (e.g. an
          MCP child polling) can read WORKING even if the model turn itself is
          wedged with a lost completion frame, extending that turn to the 2h
          ``_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`` backstop rather than reaping at 90s. This
          is an inherent property of the shared ``LivenessOracle`` (the kiro
          path has it too); tighter per-branch attribution belongs in
          ``liveness.py``, shared by both callers, not here.

        A timed-out await does not stop its executor thread. The one-outstanding-
        walk bound, the refused-submission-reads-UNKNOWN contract, and exception
        retrieval all live in the shared :func:`consult_offloaded` guard.
        ``_prompt_loop`` retires the tracked future at turn start under
        ``_turn_lock``, so a walk abandoned by one turn never gates the next (at
        the cost of one abandoned worker per turn, versus one per silent read
        before this guard existed).
