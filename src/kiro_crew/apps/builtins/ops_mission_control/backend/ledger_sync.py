"""Git-native ledger sync — shared memory for a team, with no server.

Team knowledge belongs in a git-tracked, append-only JSONL file — one JSON object per
line with an author and a timestamp. That shape is not an accident: an append-only JSONL
file in a git repo *is* a distributed shared-memory primitive, provided two writers who
learn the same thing produce the same bytes.

This app's ledger already has that property — ids are content-addressed over
`(pattern, fix)`, so two people who independently learn one lesson write one id. What
was missing was the transport. This module is the transport, and deliberately nothing
more:

- **No new data model.** The synced artifact is `ledger.jsonl` exactly as written
  locally. A teammate's copy is readable by an instance that has never heard of sync.
- **No server.** Git is the coordination substrate; GitHub (or any remote) is the
  shared place. Identity and access control are the remote's problem, which is the
  point — a team that can already share a repo can already share memory.
- **Only the ledger.** NOT the dispatch index. The index is last-writer-wins on a
  shared key, so syncing it would silently let two instances believe they each own an
  incident. Cross-instance claim arbitration is a separate contract that has to be
  designed, not a file copy. See the module spec.

**Conflicts are expected and already handled.** Verified against a real `git merge` of
two divergent ledgers: git DOES conflict (both branches append to the same region), so
this is not the "content addressing means no conflicts" story. What content addressing
buys is that the conflicted file is *reconcilable* — `ledger.read_entries` skips the
`<<<<<<<` markers as malformed lines and merges duplicate ids. So the app stays correct
mid-merge, and `resolve_conflict` finishes the job by rewriting the file from the
already-reconciled entries.

**Pull before you match, push after you learn** — the INTENDED ordering, and stated here as
intent because the wiring does not yet deliver it. Pulling before a ledger match is what
makes a teammate's lesson available to this investigation, and pushing after recording one is
what makes yours available to theirs.

What actually runs is coarser: the only caller of this transport is the daily
``POST /ledger/hygiene`` pass on the ``primary`` tier, so exchange happens once a day on one
box rather than around each match. Recorded here rather than left as an aspiration a reader
would mistake for a description — see ``sync_safely`` for what the gap costs, which is more
than latency because ``rotation.yaml`` rides the same repo.

    CONFLICT STATE WAS MISSING, AND IT WAS THE ONE STATE THAT LIES. ``push`` REFUSES
    outright while ``rotation.yaml`` holds conflict markers (see the guard below), but it
    said so only to the log and to a SEL audit line: ``sync_safely`` swallows the refusal
    into a ``logger.warning``, and the daily hygiene handler drops it into a response
    nobody reads. Meanwhile this function reported "Syncing …" — so an operator whose
    schedule conflicted watched a card claim sync was working while every single push was
    refused. The cost is not cosmetic: nothing new reaches the team's ledger, and the
    schedule that gates who picks up work stays unparseable for everyone who pulls it.
    Both detectors already exist, are cheap file reads, and never raise, so there was no
    reason for this to be invisible.

    "SYNCING ON BRANCH <b>" WAS A SECOND OVERSTATED CLAIM, and it was true nowhere.
    ``git init`` was run with no ``-b``, so git picked its own default (``master``) and  # wokeignore:rule=master
    nothing ever moved HEAD onto the configured branch — ``branch()`` was used ONLY inside
    fetch/merge/push refspecs. Found by inspecting the author's live install: config said
    ``main``, ``.git/HEAD`` said ``master``, and there was no ``[branch]`` section at all.  # wokeignore:rule=master
    Sync worked, by accident of those explicit refspecs, while this card named a ref the
    local repo was not on. The cost landed on the operator: with no upstream, the two
    obvious recovery commands both fail outright (``git pull`` → "no tracking information
    for the current branch"; ``git push`` → "the current branch master has no upstream  # wokeignore:rule=master
    branch") — and a conflicted ``rotation.yaml``, which the push guard above REFUSES, is
    exactly the case that has to be fixed by hand in that directory.

    ``local_branch`` / ``branch_matches`` / ``detached`` exist so the card can tell the
    operator which of those it is. ``initialized`` deliberately stays gated on
    ``.is_dir()``, so a ``.git`` FILE (a worktree or submodule gitdir pointer) reads as

    index long before any sync runs. This catches what that cannot: an entry written by an
    older build, or one that reached the file by some path other than that route.

    Uses the UNION of two detectors, because neither is a superset of the other and this is
    the last gate before bytes leave the machine:

    - ``security.get_credential_patterns()`` — the core accessor, which exists specifically so
      a downstream scan cannot be silently turned into a no-op by a rename, and which means a
      pattern added for any other egress site starts protecting this one too. It carries the
      AKIA/ASIA shapes.
    - ``secrets.redact_tokens`` — this app's own detector, which knows the PROVIDER credential
      shapes the core has no reason to: a `Bearer` header, a prefixed Datadog application key
      (`ddapp_…`), a PagerDuty token.

    Review found the omission and was right; measured before fixing, the gap runs in BOTH
    directions — the core patterns miss `ddapp_…` while `redact_tokens` misses
    `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`. Either detector alone therefore lets a real credential through, so
    a line is credential-bearing if EITHER flags it. A legacy row (written by an older build,
    or by some path other than `POST /ledger`) holding a provider token would otherwise have
    been committed to the team's shared remote.

    Returns line NUMBERS, never the matched text: the caller logs this to SEL and to the
    operator's console, and echoing the secret into either would be the leak this function
    exists to prevent. Never raises — an unreadable ledger is reported as clean because
    the commit/push that follows will fail on its own and say why, whereas raising here

    The pull half was added because ``rotation.yaml`` travels in this repo and hygiene is
    gated to the primary — so a non-primary instance had no code path that ever fetched
    the schedule. It kept arming (or not) off whatever it last saw, which is the
    double-claim the single-owner model exists to prevent, reintroduced by the transport
    rather than by the model. ``run_cycle`` pulls BEFORE reading the shift, since pulling
    after would gate the current cycle on the stale file and only help the next one.

    Push stays daily and primary-only: publishing is the leader's job, and a per-cycle
    push from every instance is the concurrent-write problem this asymmetry avoids. So
    lessons still converge on a daily cadence even though the schedule now converges per
    heartbeat — the module docstring's "pull before you match" is now true, "push after
    you learn" is still aspirational.

    Shared memory improving an investigation is worth having; it is never worth losing a
    claim over, so an unreachable remote degrades to "this instance works from what it
    already knows".

    One retry on the FIRST attempt, because the sandbox backend probe is deliberately
    deferred off the event loop on a cold cache and raises a self-described TRANSIENT
    error telling the caller to retry ("cache warms in ms"). A real roundtrip hit this
    on every first push in a fresh process — the whole first sync failed for a condition
    that resolves in milliseconds. The retry is bounded at one and only re-runs an
    idempotent git step, so it cannot mask a genuine fault.
