"""The PlatformContext composition object and the active-context accessor.

KiroCrew uses the Composed Platform Providers (CPP) model to share one core
between the public open-source edition and the Amazon-internal companion.  The
public core defines a set of *extension points* — interfaces in
``kiro_crew.platform.interfaces`` — and ships a ``Default*`` adapter for each
that reproduces today's open-source behavior.  An internal companion package
supplies Amazon adapters for the same interfaces.

The :class:`PlatformContext` is the frozen object, built once at boot, that
holds the chosen adapter for every extension point.  Core code reads only from
the context (directly when it has it, or via :func:`current_context` for
module-level functions), so the public core never names an Amazon class.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/platform-context.md``.

# ── Reserved (declared-inert) slots ──

# A field listed here is part of the published contract but has NO consumption
# site in the core: overriding it changes NOTHING.  The declaration lives HERE,

# "NOT YET WIRED" notes were buried in ``interfaces.py``/``defaults.py``
# docstrings — invisible from the composition root where an edition author
# writes ``dataclasses.replace(ctx, package_manager=MyPackageManager())`` and
# gets silence.
#
# Two enforcement arms keep this honest and rot-proof, both in
# ``test_platform_cpp_seam_coverage.py``:
#
#   1. Every ``PlatformContext`` field must be EITHER consumed by non-platform
#      core code OR listed here.  A new field with no consumption site fails the
#      build instead of becoming the next dead seam.
#   2. A field listed here must have NO non-platform consumption site.  So
#      wiring a reserved slot fails the build until its entry is deliberately
#      REMOVED from this map — the marker cannot silently outlive the inertness
#      it documents.
#
# At runtime, ``PlatformContext.__post_init__`` logs one loud warning per
# reserved slot that carries a non-default value (see ``_warn_reserved_slots``).
# It WARNS rather than raises on purpose: an edition may legitimately compose an
# adapter in anticipation of a slot being wired (its own composition root is
# built in lockstep with the core), and refusing to compose would turn a
# forward-looking, harmless override into a boot failure — a breaking change for
# an out-of-tree companion that composes this seam today.  The warning is the

    The CPP fail-closed invariant: a :class:`PlatformCompositionError` (a
    non-standalone host that could not compose its companion) MUST abort rather
    than silently degrade to open-source defaults — so it is always re-raised.
    Any *other* exception (a transient adapter failure) degrades to the fallback
    so a best-effort lookup never breaks the caller.

    Centralizing the idiom here means a call site cannot accidentally swallow
    ``PlatformCompositionError`` by writing a bare ``except Exception``.

    The fallback is supplied EITHER eagerly via ``fallback`` OR lazily via
    ``fallback_factory`` (at least one is REQUIRED — passing neither raises
    ``TypeError`` at the call site rather than leaking the ``_UNSET`` sentinel).
    Prefer ``fallback_factory`` when building the fallback is itself expensive or
    fallible: it is invoked ONLY on the degrade path and INSIDE the ``except``
    block, so (a) a happy-path call never pays to build a fallback it discards,
    and (b) an exception raised while building the fallback is still handled here
    rather than escaping the helper uncaught.

    ``log_message`` is logged at debug on the degrade path; pass ``None`` for
    callers that must not log (e.g. a stdio MCP server whose stray writes would
    corrupt the JSON-RPC stream).

    fallback`` idiom.

    Routes through ``current_context().credentials.redact`` so a loaded Amazon
    companion's extra credential/cookie regexes apply.  The Default
    ``CredentialPolicy.redact`` delegates to ``security.redact``, so a standalone
    process gets byte-for-byte today's redaction.  Recursion-safe: the Default
    delegates to the bare ``security.redact``, which never calls back into the
    context — only *callers* route through this shim.

    Fail-closed: a :class:`PlatformCompositionError` (a non-standalone host that

    host does NOT silently downgrade redaction to the OSS baseline.  Any other
    (transient) adapter failure degrades to the bare ``security.redact`` so the
    security pass never silently disappears.
