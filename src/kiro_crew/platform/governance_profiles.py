"""Phase 5 — profile store + active-scope resolution (per-surface / app / task).

Level 2 of the governance model.  A *profile* is a narrow-only ceiling bound to
a surface (``cron``/``slack``/``dashboard``/``subagent``/…), an app slug, or a
task id.  At each tool call the active profile is resolved from the session key
and agent, then intersected with the policy ceiling by ``governance.resolve``.

Kept apart from the pure-data ``governance`` module (which has no I/O) so the
filesystem read + mtime hot-reload + fallback policy live in one place — the
same split the config package uses (schema/eval vs loader).

Resolution principles (from the design + the grounding analysis):

* **Single owner per surface.** The active profile is keyed on the *session
  key* taxonomy (``sel._infer_source`` is the canonical classifier — reused, not
  re-implemented) and the agent name; never on a human-supplied value.
* **Deny-by-default on unproven identity.** A surface whose identity cannot be
  established resolves to the most-restrictive built-in profile
  (``deny_all_profile``), mirroring the dashboard ``api_session_tool_policy``
  precedent — never a permissive fall-through.
* **Invalid profile → deny-all, not the ceiling** (Validation rule 5): a
  schema-invalid profile file must not silently widen to the policy ceiling.
* **Hot-reload via mtime fingerprint** (reusing the config loader's cheap
  ``st_mtime_ns + st_size`` signature idea) so an operator edit is picked up
  without a restart, while the policy ceiling stays boot-frozen.
