    An operations-based seam rather than a binary-name one: rather than naming a

    implements these OPERATIONS and OWNS its own invocation grammar, output
    parsing, and error translation. The core calls an operation and only
    serializes the result / applies side effects (config sync, agent rebuild).

    The public Default is unavailable (``available()`` → ``False``), so the
    ``/api/capability/*`` handlers report "not available" (HTTP 503); a companion
    implements registry-backed MCP/skill/agent management. Every op is ``async``
    (it does I/O) and MUST NOT be called when ``available()`` is ``False``.

    LIVENESS: operations MUST be internally time-bounded — a slow companion op
    must not stall MCP handlers, so an edition's ops must not block
    indefinitely. As defense-in-depth the core also wraps every async op with
    ``asyncio.wait_for`` (differentiated bounds: tight for uninstall, generous
    for install so a legitimate cold package-manager download is not cancelled
    mid-mutation, and a tight read bound on ``list_*``/``registry`` — the
    dashboard polls those, so a stalled unbounded read would accumulate pending
    gateway tasks, the same wedge class this prevents). Only the sync
    ``available()`` probe is unwrapped (it does no I/O). That wrapper
    (``platform.capability_bound.BoundedCapabilityManager``)
    is applied at CONTEXT COMPOSITION — ``PlatformContext.__post_init__`` binds
    every ``CapabilityManager`` once — so EVERY reader of
    ``current_context().capability_manager`` inherits the bound, whether it routes
    through the dashboard ``_capability_manager()`` accessor or reads the context
    directly (a subagent, conductor, MCP-tool, or apps-backend consumer). The bind
    is idempotent, so the companion's ``dataclasses.replace`` composition path does
    not double-wrap. The core additionally runs ``/api/mcp/apply`` companion
    ``uninstall_mcp`` calls in a phase BEFORE it takes the process-wide MCP file

        WIRED: ``metrics/provider.py::_otlp_destinations`` calls this once per
        recorder build — after the consent gate, before any reader is
        constructed — and builds one ``PeriodicExportingMetricReader`` per
        returned destination that names ``"metrics"`` in its ``signals``,
        ALONGSIDE (never instead of) the built-in local JSONL reader.  An empty
        sequence means local-only, with no network egress.

        The public default returns one destination when
        ``telemetry.otlp_endpoint`` is a non-empty string and nothing when it is
        not, so a standalone build stays byte-identical to the hardcoded
        endpoint-only exporter this replaced.  An edition overrides it to reach
        its own collector — including one whose credential ROTATES during
        process lifetime, which the once-at-construction
        ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`` injection cannot express.

        ADD-only by construction: destinations are appended to the core's reader
        list, so this can never remove or replace the local sink, and it cannot
        relax consent, attribute sanitisation, or the histogram views.  A
        destination with an empty ``endpoint``, or one that does not name the
        signal being built, is DROPPED rather than trusted — deny-by-default, so
        a half-populated descriptor cannot start an unintended egress.

        Best-effort: the build path reads it through ``safe_context_call``
        (fallback ``()``), so a provider that raises contributes no destinations
        and telemetry keeps working local-only instead of failing.

        MUST be cheap and side-effect-free per call. It is read once per recorder
        build AND on every egress-posture read — the Privacy panel's status and
        each ``telemetry.enabled`` config write ask it so their disclosure cannot
        disagree with what gets attached. So do not acquire a token, mint a
        credential, or perform any one-shot side effect inside it: build the
