"""Pull-request source data and owner-only review-thread mutation.

The browser sends a GitHub pull-request or GitLab merge-request URL. This
module validates the parsed host and path, then delegates authentication to a
validated absolute provider CLI. Credentials stay inside ``gh``/``glab`` and are
never returned to the browser. Credential-backed access is restricted to the
configured dashboard owner. Standalone local dashboards use their signed
bootstrap identity as the implicit owner when no channel owner is configured.

    the workflow sets an explicit ``name:`` (``Backend Tests (3.12, 4)``), so
    sibling shards never share an identity and one shard's failure can never be
    folded into another's success.

    The row KIND separates GitHub's two rollup shapes. ``__typename`` comes
    straight from the GraphQL union and is present on every row ``gh`` returns; a
    row without it (a hand-built dict) is classified from the fields each shape

    status-only. Do NOT discriminate on the absence of ``name``: a status row
    carrying both ``context`` and ``name`` would be read as a check-run and
    collide with a nameless one, which ``_github_check`` normalizes to the same
    ``"Check"`` placeholder.

    A check-run with NO workflow (published by an app outside Actions) is left
    deliberately UNCOLLAPSED — its per-row detail URL, else its position, joins
    the identity. Such rows are the one case this payload cannot adjudicate: the

    id, so a superseded re-run is indistinguishable from a same-named check from
