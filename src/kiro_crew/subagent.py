        Why this is a separate coroutine run under ``asyncio.shield`` (see

        reaches the parent. Running the report on a shielded, strongly-held task
        makes it complete independently of caller cancellation.

        This dual behavior is intentional for headless callers (e.g.
        Mochi bg agent) that have no UI to respond to approval prompts.

        endpoint (requires X-Internal-Secret), not from LLM tool calls.

            model (str): Model override for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            reasoning_effort (str): Per-call reasoning-effort override; wins
                over the ``role_efforts['subagent']`` pin. ``""`` defers to it.
            allowed_tools (list): Tool allowlist for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            bare (bool): Launch CC in bare mode (ignored for ACP).
            cwd (str): Optional absolute path where the subagent subprocess
                launches instead of the default ``subagent_<id>`` sandbox.
                Validated against ``AgentConfig.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots``;
                rejected spawns return a done ``SubagentInfo`` with ``error``
                set. Enables cwd-relative resource globs (``AGENTS.md``,
                ``.kiro/steering``, ``CLAUDE.md``) to resolve correctly.
            approval_mode (str | None): "auto" to skip spawn gate and
                set session-level auto-approve.  Only honored from
                authenticated internal callers (X-Internal-Secret).

        finalization: completion is reached from many terminal paths (normal,
        error, timeout, cancel-recovery, reaper), all guarded by a carefully
        ordered 3-guard finally — a watcher observes the outcome without
        adding a new obligation to any of them. Waits for the run's task to be
        popped from ``self._tasks`` too, so teardown (session release) has
        finished before the continuation tries to reuse the conversation; any
        residual ``conversation_busy`` gets a bounded retry.

        (suppressed, expired, dispatch failure) announces a SYNTHETIC failure
        completion event through the normal ``_on_done`` path — the parent
        must not wait forever on an event that is not coming.

        plus a margin, and the task is registered in ``_followup_watchers`` so

        """Respawn *info*'s run on a fresh task after an unexpected cancellation.

        Called from ``_run``'s CancelledError handler — the current task is
        being cancelled and cannot continue itself, so the continuation runs on
        a new task. One-shot: gated by ``info._cancel_retry_used`` at the call
        site. The original run's finally block still performs session cleanup
        (release/reset) but skips terminal finalization while ``_recovering``.

        **Cancellation-source contract.** This branch exists for cancellations
        that arrive from OUTSIDE the manager's own lifecycle — in practice the
        parent task tree being torn down around a live subagent (e.g. a
        dashboard slot reset/removal cancelling background tasks, or an event
        during gateway component re-init) — mirroring the main path's
        unexpected-cancel recovery. Every INTENTIONAL cancel site in
        this module sets a terminal marker before cancelling, and the recovery
        branch defers to all of them: ``cancel()`` sets ``user_stopped``,
        ``cancel_all()`` sets ``_shutting_down``, and ``_force_reap`` sets
        ``reaped`` (checked before the recovery branch). Any NEW code path that
        cancels a subagent task on purpose MUST set one of those markers first,
        or the cancel will be treated as unexpected and recovered once.

        Coordination is explicit, not timed: ``_resume`` awaits the ORIGINAL
        task object to fully complete (its finally does session release/reset,
        slot decrement, and pops the task registry) before respawning. This
        guarantees the old finally can neither pop the new task out of
        ``self._tasks`` nor emit a duplicate completion, and the respawn never
        starts against a session whose reset is still in flight. The respawn
        then re-acquires a slot by waiting for capacity (the old finally's
        ``_drain_queue`` may have admitted a queued spawn into the freed slot),
        so the concurrency ceiling is never exceeded.

        The pending ``_resume`` task itself is registered in ``self._tasks``
        (under ``"<id>:recovery"``) so ``cancel_all()`` reaches it during
        shutdown — a recovery can never outlive or escape manager teardown.
