"""Full new-path dispatch: TelegramTransport -> TurnDriver -> TelegramRenderer.

``TelegramTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound update and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`TelegramDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Slack transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact, /model, /yolo, /help)
    -> construct TelegramRenderer + on_turn_start (immediate ack placeholder)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_callback`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``TelegramApprovalDecider.resolve_global``), applies ``/model`` picks
(``m:<index>``) and re-injects ``[OPTIONS:]`` choices (``opt:<i>``) as fresh
turns.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

        names state belonging to the host rather than to this conversation -- every
        session on the box, every scheduled job -- would disclose it to members who
        were never allow-listed at all. Same rule `/kirocrew dashboard` follows.

        Scoped to the LISTINGS, and per argument rather than per command. It is not
        "host-wide command" as a category: `/spawn <task>` and `/task run <spec>` act
        on THIS conversation's session and report on their own work, and `/stop` and
        `/compact` are how a forum operator drives the Topic they are in. Refusing
        those would break the forum surface to no benefit, since a caller who can
        reach them already had to be allow-listed.

        But the same command changes scope with its argument, which the command name
        does not show: `/spawn list` renders every subagent on the box with its task
        text, and `/task status` reports the one global runner. `lists_host_state`
        (`messaging/commands.py`) is the answer to that, held next to the functions
        that build those replies -- reading `/spawn <task>` and generalizing to
        `/spawn` is precisely how the listing got through the first time.

        Slack's equivalents have no such shape -- their reply lands in a DM or in a
