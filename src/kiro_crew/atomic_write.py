    Windows that rename fails with ``PermissionError`` if any other handle is
    open on either path. An indexer or an AV scanner touching the freshly
    written temp file is enough, so a correct atomic write can still lose its

    only real boundary against a same-UID reader, and the caller sees success.
    Issue #4381 is the class report; a per-caller check was rejected there as
    whack-a-mole, so the refusal lives in the one helper every secret write
    already goes through.

    Two checks, because neither alone is sufficient:

    * an ``lstat`` walk over the components BELOW the anchor, which is the only
      thing that sees a Windows junction (``is_link_or_junction``, since
      ``islink`` reports False for one);

      would pass while still landing the secret somewhere the caller never
      named. Equality also covers a redirect the walk cannot see, such as a
      reparse point a platform's ``realpath`` follows but ``islink`` misses.

    Only the parent CHAIN is checked. A link at the leaf is not a redirect:
    ``os.replace`` does not follow the final component, so it replaces the link
    itself with the new file (verified — the link's target keeps its old
    contents), which is the same outcome as writing over a regular file.

    lstat-based, so it is not race-free: a link planted between this check and
    the ``mkstemp`` below still wins. Closing that would need an ``O_NOFOLLOW``
    descent with a directory handle per component, which ``tempfile`` cannot be
    driven through. ``memory.py``'s lock-path check states the same limitation

    *mode* sets explicit permissions (e.g. ``0o600`` for secrets).

    explicit *mode* alongside it is a caller bug, and narrowing it silently
    would hide that. It further implies :func:`_refuse_linked_parent`: a secret
    writer must never follow a link, because a pre-planted parent symlink or
    junction redirects the whole write to a location the caller never named
    (issue #4381).

    *restrict_on_error* selects what happens when that lockdown fails, and only
    means anything alongside ``restrict_to_owner=True``. The default ``"raise"``
    refuses to write a secret it cannot protect. ``"warn"`` logs and writes
    anyway, for the callers whose own comments say the write matters more than
    the permissions: ``sel.py`` must not brick SecurityEventLog init on a
    read-only filesystem, and ``dashboard/refresh_tokens.py`` must not drop
    refresh-token reuse-detection state. Note the asymmetry the two platforms
    give ``"warn"``: on POSIX ``restrict_to_owner`` is ``chmod(0o600)``, which
    the ``fchmod_safe`` below repeats, so the file still lands at ``0o600``
    after a warn; on Windows ``fchmod_safe`` is a no-op, so a warn genuinely
    publishes the file under its inherited ACL. That is the exposure those
    callers accept today, stated rather than implied.
