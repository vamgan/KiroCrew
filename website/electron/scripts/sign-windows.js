// electron-builder custom Windows sign hook: Authenticode-sign via AWS Signer.
//
// WHY A HOOK RATHER THAN A POST-BUILD STEP: the NSIS installer is a
// self-extracting archive. electron-builder signs the app executable, compresses
// it into the installer payload, and signs the installer and its generated
// uninstaller -- so signing after the build would mean unpacking and rebuilding
// that structure by hand. A hook signs each file at the moment electron-builder
// would have called signtool, so the ordering stays theirs.
//
// There is no certificate on this machine: the private key lives in the signing
// service and never leaves it. Signing is an S3 round-trip -- upload the file,
// a Signer-owned Lambda picks it up and calls StartSigningJob, we read the
// signed bytes back. See docs/windows-signing.md in KiroCrewPublishCDK.
//
// Credentials come from the OIDC role the workflow assumes; nothing is stored
// here. Like scripts/notarize.js, this SKIPS cleanly when the environment is
// not configured so credential-less local and fork builds still produce an
// (unsigned) installer instead of failing. build-windows.yml sets the five
// values below only when the signing secret is present, so an unconfigured CI
// run reaches the same skip path rather than calling the AWS CLI without
// credentials. A PARTIAL environment is a misconfiguration and throws --
// silently shipping unsigned from a build meant to sign is worse than failing.
//
// Env (all required to enable signing):
//   WINDOWS_SIGNING_UNSIGNED_BUCKET  where we upload; a Lambda watches it
//   WINDOWS_SIGNING_SIGNED_BUCKET    where Signer writes the signed artifact
//   WINDOWS_SIGNING_PROFILE_ID       profile identifier, e.g. KiroCrewWindowsExe
//   WINDOWS_SIGNING_ARTIFACT_ROLE    ArtifactAccessRole to assume
//   WINDOWS_SIGNING_EXTERNAL_ID      sts:ExternalId (equals the Signer app name)
// Optional:
//   WINDOWS_SIGNING_PLATFORM         default AuthenticodeSigner-SHA256-RSA
//   AWS_REGION                       default us-west-2 (the signing service
//                                    supports only a few regions)

/**
 * Run the AWS CLI under the ArtifactAccessRole profile.
 *
 * The role is reached with an `~/.aws/credentials` profile rather than an
 * inline `sts assume-role`: ArtifactAccessRole requires an ExternalId, and a
 * named profile with `credential_source = Environment` lets the CLI chain from
 * the workflow's OIDC credentials and pass that ExternalId on every call
 * without us handling temporary keys ourselves.
 *
 * `--output json` is pinned here rather than at the one call site that parses
 * the response: the CLI's output format is ambient config (AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT,
 * or `output = text` in a runner image's ~/.aws/config), so a caller that
 * assumes JSON is one environment away from feeding `text` to JSON.parse. It
 * costs nothing on the calls whose output we ignore.
