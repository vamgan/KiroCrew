/**
 * The drawer settle's CURVES, pinned with the numbers that chose them.
 *
 * The settle is ASYMMETRIC: arriving and leaving are different events.
 *
 * ENTRY — the guard here is a FIRST-FRAME budget, and it is a restored one. It
 * existed, was deleted when a more front-loaded curve was adopted on the theory
 * that front-loading was not what made an earlier shape read wrong, and three
 * device verdicts then said otherwise: easeOutExpo `(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1)` at 340ms
 * (26% of the travel gone in the first painted frame), easeOutQuint
 * `(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` at 320ms (30%) and `(0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 1)` at 320ms (39%)
 * were each rejected for reading as the panel appearing rather than sliding. The
 * accepted shape is iOS's sheet curve `(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`, which spends 10% —
 * and which `components/OverlayDrawer.tsx` had already been using all along, for
 * the reason its own comment gives: "a strong ease-out front-loads the travel,
 * which visually freezes the near edges while the far edges are still sweeping."
 * So the budget is not a preference, it is the same conclusion reached twice.
 *
 * EXIT — its budget is at the front too, but inverted: a dismissal must start
 * from where the panel IS. A shared easeOut exit jumps off the edge and then
 * crawls to a stop, which is what the first symmetric pairing got wrong.
 *
 * The two curves are also the Notification Center sheet's, asserted here as one
 * motion language across both files.
