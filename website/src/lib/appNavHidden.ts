/**
 * Pin-persistence contract for the sidebar Apps group (Library launchpad).
 *
 * The Library page's launchpad grid lets the user choose which installed
 * apps appear ("pinned") in the sidebar. Persistence stores the HIDDEN set
 * — a JSON string array of app nav ids under `mc-app-nav-hidden` — not the
 * visible set, so a newly installed app defaults to pinned with no
 * migration: an id absent from the list is visible.
 *
 * Both writers/readers (LibraryPage tiles and the App.tsx sidebar filter)
 * MUST go through this module so the contract lives in one place. Writes
 * dispatch `mc:app-nav-hidden-changed` on window because same-tab
 * localStorage writes do not fire the `storage` event — the sidebar
 * subscribes to that event to re-render immediately when a tile's pin
 * badge is toggled.
