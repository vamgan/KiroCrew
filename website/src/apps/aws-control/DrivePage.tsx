/**
 * AWS Control - the cloud drive, as its own page.
 *
 * Reached from the Cloud drive capability row on the account console; a
 * breadcrumb returns. Like the console it is view state inside `AwsControlPage`
 * rather than a route of its own, because `BuiltinAppRoute` resolves only
 * single-segment routes.
 *
 * One bucket holds three sections behind their own prefixes - the artifact
 * library, the file drive, and backups - and this page is where all three live,
 * together with the share ledger that governs links into them. They were four
 * stacked sections on the account console; that page now carries one row saying
 * the drive exists, and everything about its CONTENTS is here.
 *
 * The file listing renders through the shared library table header
 * (`components/library/LibraryTable`), declaring its own columns: an S3 object
 * has no slug, kind, source, version or tags, so the artifact library's nine
 * columns would have to be invented for it. What IS shared is the header chrome
 * - the sort control and the pinned Actions cell with its measured seam - which
 * is the part that is subtle and expensive to keep in sync by hand.
 *
 * Every mutation is confirmed before it runs and ends by invalidating its
 * react-query key. All AWS access runs through the gateway's audited CLI
 * chokepoint; this surface never talks to AWS from the browser.

                        component for a row inside a scrolling table. Keeping the
                        destructive act behind the trigger also means a
                        slightly-off click on a row that OPENS on click cannot
