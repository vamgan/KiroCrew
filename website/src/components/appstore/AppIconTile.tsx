/**
 * AppIconTile — the square icon thumbnail shared by the store's LIST surfaces.
 *
 * Discover's ``AppListRow`` and the Library's ``LaunchpadTile`` render the
 * same app, so they must render the same thumbnail with the same fallback chain:
 * the app's theme-appropriate icon → a name-hashed gradient carrying a glyph.
 * Keeping that in one component is what stops the two tabs from drifting apart
 * — the Library shipped a flat lucide icon for a whole release because the rule
 * lived only inside AppListRow.
 *
 * WHY A LIST ROW SHOWS AN ICON AND NOT HERO ART. Hero art is EDITORIAL: it is
 * the argument for one app, and it earns its space on the spotlight and the
 * feature cards, where there are two or three of them and each gets a wide
 * panel. A list is the opposite job — it is scanned, and the reader is matching
 * a name to a mark they already recognise. A 16:9 crop of someone's marketing
 * art at 96x54 is neither: too small to read as art, too large to scan as an
 * identity, and it makes twelve rows look like twelve billboards. The icon is
 * the app's identity at any size, which is what a list needs.
 *
 * That split also means the two kinds of image now have exactly one owner each:
 * ``useHeroArt`` is reached only from the editorial surfaces, and this component
 * is the only thumbnail a list renders.
 *
 * The two callers differ only in vertical alignment (Discover centers its row,
 * the Library top-aligns), so ``className`` takes the caller's box classes.
