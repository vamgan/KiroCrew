  /**
   * THE single declaration of every filter dimension. `filteredSlots`,
   * `listNarrowed`, and `revealBlockingFilters` all derive from this list, so
   * adding a dimension is one entry here — the required fields force a
   * decision per consumer, and THOSE THREE consumers cannot drift because
   * none of them enumerates dimensions itself any more. The guard's limit:
   * this declaration cannot see filtering done at the render sites (the
   * folder dimension works that way), so a dimension that acts there must
   * still answer `narrows` for real — writing `null` while narrowing the
   * visible list at a render site re-creates the under-count this exists to
   * prevent.
   *
   * The consumers legitimately answer different questions, and the per-field
   * differences below are deliberate, not drift:
   * - the folder dimension filters no rows (`filtersRow: null` — it drops
   *   whole folder blocks/lanes at the render sites) and never narrows
   *   (`narrows: null` — see the field docs on `FilterDimension`);
   * - tags narrow by the RESOLVED `activeTagIds` but hide by the raw
   *   `filterTagIds`, so a reveal arriving while the tag vocabulary is still
   *   loading (when nothing is filtered yet) still clears the tag filter
   *   instead of leaving the row to be re-hidden mid-flight.
   *
   * Bundling every consumer's state into one memo couples them: a change to
   * reveal-only state (`filterTagIds`, `filterHiddenSubtree`, `folders`)
   * re-derives `filteredSlots` — one extra filter+sort with content-identical
   * rows. Accepted: no effect keys on `filteredSlots`, and its downstream
   * memos already depend on that state themselves.
