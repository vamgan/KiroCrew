"""Contract tests for Windows Authenticode signing via AWS Signer.

Windows signing is unlike the macOS path in one structural way, and every
property below follows from it: **signing happens INSIDE the build**. The NSIS
installer is a self-extracting archive -- the app executable is signed, then
compressed into the installer payload, then the installer and its generated
uninstaller are signed -- so signing afterwards would mean unpacking and
rebuilding that structure by hand. Instead
``website/electron/scripts/sign-windows.js`` hooks electron-builder wherever it
would have called ``signtool``.

That makes the Windows build job hold a production signing identity, which the
macOS legs deliberately do not. It is also why Windows has its own reusable
workflow: ``build-desktop.yml`` is pinned credential-free by
``test_workflow_permissions.py``, and putting the signing leg back in it would
hand OIDC to the mac and Linux legs too.

The properties that keep this safe, none of which fails at PR time if broken:

* **``id-token: write`` is granted by the callers.** A reusable workflow can
  never exceed its caller's permissions, so a callee declaring OIDC is not
  enough -- the nightly/release caller jobs must grant it. Pinned in
  ``test_workflow_permissions.py``; asserted here from the callee side.
* **The prod environment is requested on publishing paths.** The signing role's
  OIDC trust accepts exactly ``ref:refs/heads/main`` and ``environment:prod``.
  Release runs are tag-triggered (``ref:refs/tags/v*``, untrusted), so without
  the environment they cannot assume the role. It must NOT be requested on the
  any-ref dispatch probe, whose refs the prod branch policy rejects.
* **The hook is wired into electron-builder.** A ``win`` config without
  ``signtoolOptions.sign`` builds a perfectly good UNSIGNED installer, silently.
* **``CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY`` stays false.** There is no certificate on the
  runner -- the private key lives in the signing service and never leaves it.
  Letting electron-builder hunt for a local certificate invites it to pick up
  something unexpected instead of going through the hook.
* **The five ``WINDOWS_SIGNING_*`` values are gated on the same flag as the
  credentials.** They are inline literals, so if they were set unconditionally
  the hook could never reach its "not configured" skip path: it would find a
  full environment, call the AWS CLI without credentials, and FAIL the build on
  every fork and on any repo without the secret. That regression is the reason
  this file asserts the gate and not just the values.

``sts:ExternalId`` must equal the Signer application name, which is undocumented
and load-bearing -- without it any principal in the allowlisted account can
assume the artifact role.
