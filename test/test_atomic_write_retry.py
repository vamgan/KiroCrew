"""Tests for the Windows atomic-rename retry in ``atomic_write`` (issue #1105).

``os.replace`` on Windows raises ``PermissionError`` while any other handle is
open on either path, so an indexer or AV scanner touching the freshly written
temp file can defeat an otherwise-correct atomic write. POSIX permits the
replace, so the failure never reproduces on a dev machine and only surfaces on
the ``Backend Tests (Windows)`` matrix.

``windows_sim.replace_sharing_violation`` reproduces the fault deterministically
on any OS, so these drive the exact code path a Windows host would take. They do
NOT prove the real OS behaviour end-to-end, only that the retry is wired,
bounded, gated to Windows, and gated off the event loop.
