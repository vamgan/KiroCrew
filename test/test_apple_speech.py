"""Tests for the ``apple`` STT provider (kiro_crew.apple_speech).

The provider is macOS-only and its real work happens in a compiled Swift helper, so
the tests split three ways: platform-gating logic (runs everywhere, with the platform
faked), the Python-side plumbing (subprocess contract, JSON parsing, transcode
fallback), and one genuine end-to-end run marked macOS-only.
