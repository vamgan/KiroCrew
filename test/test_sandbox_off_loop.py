"""Tests for ``shielded_prepare_off_loop`` — the shared shield over the chokepoint.

Cancel-injection test: verifies that cancelling the awaiting coroutine while the
worker is still inside ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` recovers the cleanup path and
unlinks the temp launcher/profile, rather than leaking it.

Executor test: the caller's pool is honoured, so consolidating the shield does
not silently collapse each site's ``executors.py`` pool onto the default one.

AST guard test: scans ``src/kiro_crew/`` for bare ``run_in_executor`` AND
``asyncio.to_thread`` hops referencing ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` (the sync
version) without going through the shared shield. Prevents regressions.

    Every async caller must go through ``shielded_prepare_off_loop`` so a
    cancelled awaiter cannot abandon the worker's tuple and leak the launcher.

    Two things this guard has to get right, or it passes vacuously:

    * BOTH spellings of a bare hop -- ``loop.run_in_executor(pool, fn, ...)``
      and ``asyncio.to_thread(fn, ...)``. The private copies this PR collapsed
      used the second one, so covering only the first closes half the class.
    * ONE LEVEL OF INDIRECTION. Most sites do not hand the chokepoint to the
      hop directly; they hand it a module-level preparer that calls it
      (``_prepare_probe``, ``_sandboxed``, ``_prepare_git_spawn``), whose name
      says nothing about the chokepoint. A guard matching only the literal
      ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` at the hop site is blind to exactly the sites
      this PR had to fix, so per file we first collect the functions that call
      the chokepoint and treat a hop to any of them as a hop to it.

    There is deliberately no exemption list: a site that unlinks in its own
    ``finally`` is NOT covered, because a cancellation at the hop never binds
    the tuple, so that ``finally`` sees no cleanup path to remove.
