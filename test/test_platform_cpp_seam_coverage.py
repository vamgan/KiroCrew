"""Anti-rot gate for the CPP seam: every extension point is wired or RESERVED.

The failure mode this suite exists to prevent: a ``PlatformContext`` field is
added (or an interface method is), an edition author reads the dataclass, writes
an adapter, ``dataclasses.replace``\\ s it in — and gets **silence**. No boot
warning, no log line, no failing test, because nothing in the core ever reads
the field. The seam looks like a contract but is inert.

So the contract is made total here. For every field of ``PlatformContext``,
exactly one of the following must hold:

* it has at least one **consumption site** in non-``platform/`` core code, or
* it is declared inert in ``context.RESERVED_SLOTS``.

And the reservation cannot rot in either direction:

* a reserved slot that GAINS a consumption site fails
  :func:`test_reserved_slots_have_no_consumption_site` — so wiring a slot forces
  its ``RESERVED_SLOTS`` entry to be deleted deliberately, in the same change;
* a new field with NO consumption site fails
  :func:`test_every_context_field_is_wired_or_reserved` — so it cannot quietly
  become the next dead seam.

``context.RESERVED_METHODS`` gets the same treatment one level finer, for
individual methods on fields that are otherwise live (today: the unread
``AgentRuntime.managed_mcp_servers`` and ``IdentityProvider.whoami``/``issuer``).

Consumption sites are discovered by **static analysis of the real source tree**
(``ast``), not from a hand-maintained list — a list would itself rot. See
:func:`_find_seam_reads`.
